/**
 * [866] Prime Palindrome
 *
 * Given an integer n, return the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to n.
 * An integer is prime if it has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. Note that 1 is not a prime number.
 * 
 * 	For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are all primes.
 * 
 * An integer is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.
 * 
 * 	For example, 101 and 12321 are palindromes.
 * 
 * The test cases are generated so that the answer always exists and is in the range [2, 2 * 10^8].
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * Input: n = 6
 * Output: 7
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * Input: n = 8
 * Output: 11
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * Input: n = 13
 * Output: 101
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 10^8
 *
