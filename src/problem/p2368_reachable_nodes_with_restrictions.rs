/**
 * [2368] Reachable Nodes With Restrictions
 *
 * There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.
 * You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree. You are also given an integer array restricted which represents restricted nodes.
 * Return the maximum number of nodes you can reach from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
 * Note that node 0 will not be a restricted node.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/15/ex1drawio.png" style="width: 402px; height: 322px;" />
 * Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,1],[4,0],[0,5],[5,6]], restricted = [4,5]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree.
 * We have that [0,1,2,3] are the only nodes that can be reached from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/15/ex2drawio.png" style="width: 412px; height: 312px;" />
 * Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,5],[0,4],[3,2],[6,5]], restricted = [4,2,1]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree.
 * We have that [0,5,6] are the only nodes that can be reached from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	2 <= n <= 10^5
 * 	edges.length == n - 1
 * 	edges[i].length == 2
 * 	0 <= ai, bi < n
 * 	ai != bi
 * 	edges represents a valid tree.
 * 	1 <= restricted.length < n
 * 	1 <= restricted[i] < n
 * 	All the values of restricted are unique.
