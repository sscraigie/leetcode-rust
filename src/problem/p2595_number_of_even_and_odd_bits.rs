/**
 * [2595] Number of Even and Odd Bits
 *
 * You are given a positive integer n.
 * Let even denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of n (0-indexed) with value 1.
 * Let odd denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of n (0-indexed) with value 1.
 * Return an integer array answer where answer = [even, odd].
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 17
 * Output: [2,0]
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 17 is 10001. 
 * It contains 1 on the 0^th and 4^th indices. 
 * There are 2 even and 0 odd indices.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: [0,1]
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 2 is 10.
 * It contains 1 on the 1^st index. 
 * There are 0 even and 1 odd indices.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 1000
 *
