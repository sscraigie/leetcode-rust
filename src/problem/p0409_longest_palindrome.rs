/**
 * [409] Longest Palindrome
 *
 * Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.
 * Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "abccccdd"
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "a"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= s.length <= 2000
 * 	s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.
