/**
 * [1971] Find if Path Exists in Graph
 *
 * There is a bi-directional graph with n vertices, where each vertex is labeled from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.
 * You want to determine if there is a valid path that exists from vertex source to vertex destination.
 * Given edges and the integers n, source, and destination, return true if there is a valid path from source to destination, or false otherwise.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex1.png" style="width: 141px; height: 121px;" />
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], source = 0, destination = 2
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There are two paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2:
 * - 0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 2
 * - 0 &rarr; 2
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex2.png" style="width: 281px; height: 141px;" />
 * Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,5],[5,4],[4,3]], source = 0, destination = 5
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no path from vertex 0 to vertex 5.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
 * 	0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 10^5
 * 	edges[i].length == 2
 * 	0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1
 * 	ui != vi
 * 	0 <= source, destination <= n - 1
 * 	There are no duplicate edges.
 * 	There are no self edges.
