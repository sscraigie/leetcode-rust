/**
 * [967] Numbers With Same Consecutive Differences
 *
 * Given two integers n and k, return an array of all the integers of length n where the difference between every two consecutive digits is k. You may return the answer in any order.
 * Note that the integers should not have leading zeros. Integers as 02 and 043 are not allowed.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, k = 7
 * Output: [181,292,707,818,929]
 * Explanation: Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading zeroes.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 2, k = 1
 * Output: [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	2 <= n <= 9
 * 	0 <= k <= 9
 *
