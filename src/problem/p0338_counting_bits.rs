/**
 * [338] Counting Bits
 *
 * Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: [0,1,1]
 * Explanation:
 * 0 --> 0
 * 1 --> 1
 * 2 --> 10
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 5
 * Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
 * Explanation:
 * 0 --> 0
 * 1 --> 1
 * 2 --> 10
 * 3 --> 11
 * 4 --> 100
 * 5 --> 101
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	0 <= n <= 10^5
 * 
 *  
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * 	It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of O(n log n). Can you do it in linear time O(n) and possibly in a single pass?
 * 	Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like __builtin_popcount in C++)?
 *
