/**
 * [221] Maximal Square
 *
 * Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/max1grid.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 319px;" />
 * Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/max2grid.jpg" style="width: 165px; height: 165px;" />
 * Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [["0"]]
 * Output: 0
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	m == matrix.length
 * 	n == matrix[i].length
 * 	1 <= m, n <= 300
 * 	matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
