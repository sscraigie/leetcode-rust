/**
 * [1732] Find the Highest Altitude
 *
 * There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.
 * You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	n == gain.length
 * 	1 <= n <= 100
 * 	-100 <= gain[i] <= 100
 *
