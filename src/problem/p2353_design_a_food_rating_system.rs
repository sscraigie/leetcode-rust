/**
 * [2353] Design a Food Rating System
 *
 * Design a food rating system that can do the following:
 * 
 * 	Modify the rating of a food item listed in the system.
 * 	Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.
 * 
 * Implement the FoodRatings class:
 * 
 * 	FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings) Initializes the system. The food items are described by foods, cuisines and ratings, all of which have a length of n.
 * 	
 * 		foods[i] is the name of the i^th food,
 * 		cuisines[i] is the type of cuisine of the i^th food, and
 * 		ratings[i] is the initial rating of the i^th food.
 * 	
 * 	
 * 	void changeRating(String food, int newRating) Changes the rating of the food item with the name food.
 * 	String highestRated(String cuisine) Returns the name of the food item that has the highest rating for the given type of cuisine. If there is a tie, return the item with the lexicographically smaller name.
 * 
 * Note that a string x is lexicographically smaller than string y if x comes before y in dictionary order, that is, either x is a prefix of y, or if i is the first position such that x[i] != y[i], then x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input
 * ["FoodRatings", "highestRated", "highestRated", "changeRating", "highestRated", "changeRating", "highestRated"]
 * [[["kimchi", "miso", "sushi", "moussaka", "ramen", "bulgogi"], ["korean", "japanese", "japanese", "greek", "japanese", "korean"], [9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7]], ["korean"], ["japanese"], ["sushi", 16], ["japanese"], ["ramen", 16], ["japanese"]]
 * Output
 * [null, "kimchi", "ramen", null, "sushi", null, "ramen"]
 * Explanation
 * FoodRatings foodRatings = new FoodRatings(["kimchi", "miso", "sushi", "moussaka", "ramen", "bulgogi"], ["korean", "japanese", "japanese", "greek", "japanese", "korean"], [9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7]);
 * foodRatings.highestRated("korean"); // return "kimchi"
 *                                     // "kimchi" is the highest rated korean food with a rating of 9.
 * foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "ramen"
 *                                       // "ramen" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 14.
 * foodRatings.changeRating("sushi", 16); // "sushi" now has a rating of 16.
 * foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "sushi"
 *                                       // "sushi" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 16.
 * foodRatings.changeRating("ramen", 16); // "ramen" now has a rating of 16.
 * foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "ramen"
 *                                       // Both "sushi" and "ramen" have a rating of 16.
 *                                       // However, "ramen" is lexicographically smaller than "sushi".
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
 * 	n == foods.length == cuisines.length == ratings.length
 * 	1 <= foods[i].length, cuisines[i].length <= 10
 * 	foods[i], cuisines[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
 * 	1 <= ratings[i] <= 10^8
 * 	All the strings in foods are distinct.
 * 	food will be the name of a food item in the system across all calls to changeRating.
 * 	cuisine will be a type of cuisine of at least one food item in the system across all calls to highestRated.
 * 	At most 2 * 10^4 calls in total will be made to changeRating and highestRated.
