/**
 * [981] Time Based Key-Value Store
 *
 * Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.
 * Implement the TimeMap class:
 * 
 * 	TimeMap() Initializes the object of the data structure.
 * 	void set(String key, String value, int timestamp) Stores the key key with the value value at the given time timestamp.
 * 	String get(String key, int timestamp) Returns a value such that set was called previously, with timestamp_prev <= timestamp. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest timestamp_prev. If there are no values, it returns "".
 * 
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input
 * ["TimeMap", "set", "get", "get", "set", "get", "get"]
 * [[], ["foo", "bar", 1], ["foo", 1], ["foo", 3], ["foo", "bar2", 4], ["foo", 4], ["foo", 5]]
 * Output
 * [null, null, "bar", "bar", null, "bar2", "bar2"]
 * Explanation
 * TimeMap timeMap = new TimeMap();
 * timeMap.set("foo", "bar", 1);  // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1.
 * timeMap.get("foo", 1);         // return "bar"
 * timeMap.get("foo", 3);         // return "bar", since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 is "bar".
 * timeMap.set("foo", "bar2", 4); // store the key "foo" and value "bar2" along with timestamp = 4.
 * timeMap.get("foo", 4);         // return "bar2"
 * timeMap.get("foo", 5);         // return "bar2"
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= key.length, value.length <= 100
 * 	key and value consist of lowercase English letters and digits.
 * 	1 <= timestamp <= 10^7
 * 	All the timestamps timestamp of set are strictly increasing.
 * 	At most 2 * 10^5 calls will be made to set and get.
 *
