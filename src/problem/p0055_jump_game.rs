/**
 * [55] Jump Game
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
 * Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
 * 	0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
 *
