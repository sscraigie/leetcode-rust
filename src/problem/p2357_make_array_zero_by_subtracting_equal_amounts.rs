/**
 * [2357] Make Array Zero by Subtracting Equal Amounts
 *
 * You are given a non-negative integer array nums. In one operation, you must:
 * 
 * 	Choose a positive integer x such that x is less than or equal to the smallest non-zero element in nums.
 * 	Subtract x from every positive element in nums.
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of operations to make every element in nums equal to 0.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,5,0,3,5]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * In the first operation, choose x = 1. Now, nums = [0,4,0,2,4].
 * In the second operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,2,0,0,2].
 * In the third operation, choose x = 2. Now, nums = [0,0,0,0,0].
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [0]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: Each element in nums is already 0 so no operations are needed.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 100
 * 	0 <= nums[i] <= 100
 *
