/**
 * [2239] Find Closest Number to Zero
 *
 * Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.
 * The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.
 * The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.
 * The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.
 * The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.
 * Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,-1,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 1000
 * 	-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
 *
