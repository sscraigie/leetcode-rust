 * Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the n^th day.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 4
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: After the 4^th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 10
 * Output: 37
 * Explanation: After the 10^th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2^nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.
