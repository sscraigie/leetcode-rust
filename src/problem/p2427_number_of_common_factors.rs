/**
 * [2427] Number of Common Factors
 *
 * Given two positive integers a and b, return the number of common factors of a and b.
 * An integer x is a common factor of a and b if x divides both a and b.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: a = 12, b = 6
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: a = 25, b = 30
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= a, b <= 1000
 *
