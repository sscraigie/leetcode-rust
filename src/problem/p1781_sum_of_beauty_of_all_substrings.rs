/**
 * [1781] Sum of Beauty of All Substrings
 *
 * The beauty of a string is the difference in frequencies between the most frequent and least frequent characters.
 * 
 * 	For example, the beauty of "abaacc" is 3 - 1 = 2.
 * 
 * Given a string s, return the sum of beauty of all of its substrings.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "aabcb"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The substrings with non-zero beauty are ["aab","aabc","aabcb","abcb","bcb"], each with beauty equal to 1.
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "aabcbaa"
 * Output: 17
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= s.length <=^ 500
 * 	s consists of only lowercase English letters.
