/**
 * [2280] Minimum Lines to Represent a Line Chart
 *
 * You are given a 2D integer array stockPrices where stockPrices[i] = [dayi, pricei] indicates the price of the stock on day dayi is pricei. A line chart is created from the array by plotting the points on an XY plane with the X-axis representing the day and the Y-axis representing the price and connecting adjacent points. One such example is shown below:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/30/1920px-pushkin_population_historysvg.png" style="width: 500px; height: 313px;" />
 * Return the minimum number of lines needed to represent the line chart.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/30/ex0.png" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;" />
 * Input: stockPrices = [[1,7],[2,6],[3,5],[4,4],[5,4],[6,3],[7,2],[8,1]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * The diagram above represents the input, with the X-axis representing the day and Y-axis representing the price.
 * The following 3 lines can be drawn to represent the line chart:
 * - Line 1 (in red) from (1,7) to (4,4) passing through (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and (4,4).
 * - Line 2 (in blue) from (4,4) to (5,4).
 * - Line 3 (in green) from (5,4) to (8,1) passing through (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), and (8,1).
 * It can be shown that it is not possible to represent the line chart using less than 3 lines.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/30/ex1.png" style="width: 325px; height: 325px;" />
 * Input: stockPrices = [[3,4],[1,2],[7,8],[2,3]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * As shown in the diagram above, the line chart can be represented with a single line.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= stockPrices.length <= 10^5
 * 	stockPrices[i].length == 2
 * 	1 <= dayi, pricei <= 10^9
 * 	All dayi are distinct.
