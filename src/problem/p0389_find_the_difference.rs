/**
 * [389] Find the Difference
 *
 * You are given two strings s and t.
 * String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
 * Return the letter that was added to t.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
 * Output: "e"
 * Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "", t = "y"
 * Output: "y"
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	0 <= s.length <= 1000
 * 	t.length == s.length + 1
 * 	s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
 *
