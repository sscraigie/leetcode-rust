/**
 * [2448] Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal
 *
 * You are given two 0-indexed arrays nums and cost consisting each of n positive integers.
 * You can do the following operation any number of times:
 * 
 * 	Increase or decrease any element of the array nums by 1.
 * 
 * The cost of doing one operation on the i^th element is cost[i].
 * Return the minimum total cost such that all the elements of the array nums become equal.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,3,5,2], cost = [2,3,1,14]
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: We can make all the elements equal to 2 in the following way:
 * - Increase the 0^th element one time. The cost is 2.
 * - Decrease the 1^<span style="font-size: 10.8333px;">st</span> element one time. The cost is 3.
 * - Decrease the 2^nd element three times. The cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
 * The total cost is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.
 * It can be shown that we cannot make the array equal with a smaller cost.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], cost = [4,2,8,1,3]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: All the elements are already equal, so no operations are needed.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	n == nums.length == cost.length
 * 	1 <= n <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= nums[i], cost[i] <= 10^6
 * 	Test cases are generated in a way that the output doesn't exceed 2^53-1
 *
