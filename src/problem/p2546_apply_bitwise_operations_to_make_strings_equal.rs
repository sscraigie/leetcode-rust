/**
 * [2546] Apply Bitwise Operations to Make Strings Equal
 *
 * You are given two 0-indexed binary strings s and target of the same length n. You can do the following operation on s any number of times:
 * 
 * 	Choose two different indices i and j where 0 <= i, j < n.
 * 	Simultaneously, replace s[i] with (s[i] OR s[j]) and s[j] with (s[i] XOR s[j]).
 * 
 * For example, if s = "0110", you can choose i = 0 and j = 2, then simultaneously replace s[0] with (s[0] OR s[2] = 0 OR 1 = 1), and s[2] with (s[0] XOR s[2] = 0 XOR 1 = 1), so we will have s = "1110".
 * Return true if you can make the string s equal to target, or false otherwise.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "1010", target = "0110"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: We can do the following operations:
 * - Choose i = 2 and j = 0. We have now s = "<u>0</u>0<u>1</u>0".
 * - Choose i = 2 and j = 1. We have now s = "0<u>11</u>0".
 * Since we can make s equal to target, we return true.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "11", target = "00"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: It is not possible to make s equal to target with any number of operations.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	n == s.length == target.length
 * 	2 <= n <= 10^5
 * 	s and target consist of only the digits 0 and 1.
