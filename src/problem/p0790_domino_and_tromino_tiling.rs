/**
 * [790] Domino and Tromino Tiling
 *
 * You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/15/lc-domino.jpg" style="width: 362px; height: 195px;" />
 * Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/15/lc-domino1.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 226px;" />
 * Input: n = 3
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The five different ways are show above.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: 1
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 1000
 *
