/**
 * [940] Distinct Subsequences II
 *
 * Given a string s, return the number of distinct non-empty subsequences of s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "<u>a</u>b<u>c</u>d<u>e</u>" while "aec" is not.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "abc"
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "aba"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "aa", "ba", and "aba".
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: s = "aaa"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= s.length <= 2000
 * 	s consists of lowercase English letters.
