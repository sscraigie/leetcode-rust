/**
 * [2365] Task Scheduler II
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers tasks, representing tasks that need to be completed in order, where tasks[i] represents the type of the i^th task.
 * You are also given a positive integer space, which represents the minimum number of days that must pass after the completion of a task before another task of the same type can be performed.
 * Each day, until all tasks have been completed, you must either:
 * 
 * 	Complete the next task from tasks, or
 * 	Take a break.
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of days needed to complete all tasks.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: tasks = [1,2,1,2,3,1], space = 3
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation:
 * One way to complete all tasks in 9 days is as follows:
 * Day 1: Complete the 0th task.
 * Day 2: Complete the 1st task.
 * Day 3: Take a break.
 * Day 4: Take a break.
 * Day 5: Complete the 2nd task.
 * Day 6: Complete the 3rd task.
 * Day 7: Take a break.
 * Day 8: Complete the 4th task.
 * Day 9: Complete the 5th task.
 * It can be shown that the tasks cannot be completed in less than 9 days.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: tasks = [5,8,8,5], space = 2
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation:
 * One way to complete all tasks in 6 days is as follows:
 * Day 1: Complete the 0th task.
 * Day 2: Complete the 1st task.
 * Day 3: Take a break.
 * Day 4: Take a break.
 * Day 5: Complete the 2nd task.
 * Day 6: Complete the 3rd task.
 * It can be shown that the tasks cannot be completed in less than 6 days.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= tasks.length <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= tasks[i] <= 10^9
 * 	1 <= space <= tasks.length
 *
