/**
 * [996] Number of Squareful Arrays
 *
 * An array is squareful if the sum of every pair of adjacent elements is a perfect square.
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of permutations of nums that are squareful.
 * Two permutations perm1 and perm2 are different if there is some index i such that perm1[i] != perm2[i].
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,17,8]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: [1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,2,2]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 12
 * 	0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 *
