/**
 * [2269] Find the K-Beauty of a Number
 *
 * The k-beauty of an integer num is defined as the number of substrings of num when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:
 * 
 * 	It has a length of k.
 * 	It is a divisor of num.
 * 
 * Given integers num and k, return the k-beauty of num.
 * Note:
 * 
 * 	Leading zeros are allowed.
 * 	0 is not a divisor of any value.
 * 
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: num = 240, k = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
 * - "24" from "<u>24</u>0": 24 is a divisor of 240.
 * - "40" from "2<u>40</u>": 40 is a divisor of 240.
 * Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: num = 430043, k = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
 * - "43" from "<u>43</u>0043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
 * - "30" from "4<u>30</u>043": 30 is not a divisor of 430043.
 * - "00" from "43<u>00</u>43": 0 is not a divisor of 430043.
 * - "04" from "430<u>04</u>3": 4 is not a divisor of 430043.
 * - "43" from "4300<u>43</u>": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
 * Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= num <= 10^9
 * 	1 <= k <= num.length (taking num as a string)
 *
