/**
 * [744] Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target
 *
 * You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.
 * Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
 * Output: "c"
 * Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
 * Output: "f"
 * Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
 * Output: "x"
 * Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	2 <= letters.length <= 10^4
 * 	letters[i] is a lowercase English letter.
 * 	letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 * 	letters contains at least two different characters.
 * 	target is a lowercase English letter.
