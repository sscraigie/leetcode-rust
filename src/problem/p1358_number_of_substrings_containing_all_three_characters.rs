/**
 * [1358] Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters
 *
 * Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.
 * Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "abcabc"
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "aaacb"
 * Output: 3

 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: s = "abc"
 * Output: 1
 * 
 *
