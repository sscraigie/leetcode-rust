/**
 * [2490] Circular Sentence
 *
 * A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
 * 
 * 	For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
 * 
 * Words consist of only uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.
 * A sentence is circular if:
 * 
 * 	The last character of a word is equal to the first character of the next word.
 * 	The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.
 * 
 * For example, "leetcode exercises sound delightful", "eetcode", "leetcode eats soul" are all circular sentences. However, "Leetcode is cool", "happy Leetcode", "Leetcode" and "I like Leetcode" are not circular sentences.
 * Given a string sentence, return true if it is circular. Otherwise, return false.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: sentence = "leetcode exercises sound delightful"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The words in sentence are ["leetcode", "exercises", "sound", "delightful"].
 * - leetcod<u>e</u>'s last character is equal to <u>e</u>xercises's first character.
 * - exercise<u>s</u>'s last character is equal to <u>s</u>ound's first character.
 * - soun<u>d</u>'s last character is equal to <u>d</u>elightful's first character.
 * - delightfu<u>l</u>'s last character is equal to <u>l</u>eetcode's first character.
 * The sentence is circular.
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: sentence = "eetcode"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The words in sentence are ["eetcode"].
 * - eetcod<u>e</u>'s last character is equal to <u>e</u>etcode's first character.
 * The sentence is circular.
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: sentence = "Leetcode is cool"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The words in sentence are ["Leetcode", "is", "cool"].
 * - Leetcod<u>e</u>'s last character is not equal to <u>i</u>s's first character.
 * The sentence is not circular.
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= sentence.length <= 500
 * 	sentence consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
 * 	The words in sentence are separated by a single space.
 * 	There are no leading or trailing spaces.
