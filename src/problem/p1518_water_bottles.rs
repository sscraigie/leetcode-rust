/**
 * [1518] Water Bottles
 *
 * There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.
 * The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.
 * Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/sample_1_1875.png" style="width: 500px; height: 245px;" />
 * Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
 * Output: 13
 * Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
 * Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/sample_2_1875.png" style="width: 500px; height: 183px;" />
 * Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
 * Output: 19
 * Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
 * Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= numBottles <= 100
 * 	2 <= numExchange <= 100
