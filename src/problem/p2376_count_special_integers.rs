/**
 * [2376] Count Special Integers
 *
 * We call a positive integer special if all of its digits are distinct.
 * Given a positive integer n, return the number of special integers that belong to the interval [1, n].
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 20
 * Output: 19
 * Explanation: All the integers from 1 to 20, except 11, are special. Thus, there are 19 special integers.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 5
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: All the integers from 1 to 5 are special.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: n = 135
 * Output: 110
 * Explanation: There are 110 integers from 1 to 135 that are special.
 * Some of the integers that are not special are: 22, 114, and 131.
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 2 * 10^9
 *
