/**
 * [850] Rectangle Area II
 *
 * You are given a 2D array of axis-aligned rectangles. Each rectangle[i] = [xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2] denotes the i^th rectangle where (xi1, yi1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (xi2, yi2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
 * Calculate the total area covered by all rectangles in the plane. Any area covered by two or more rectangles should only be counted once.
 * Return the total area. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/06/06/rectangle_area_ii_pic.png" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" />
 * Input: rectangles = [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: A total area of 6 is covered by all three rectangles, as illustrated in the picture.
 * From (1,1) to (2,2), the green and red rectangles overlap.
 * From (1,0) to (2,3), all three rectangles overlap.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: rectangles = [[0,0,1000000000,1000000000]]
 * Output: 49
 * Explanation: The answer is 10^18 modulo (10^9 + 7), which is 49.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= rectangles.length <= 200
 * 	rectanges[i].length == 4
 * 	0 <= xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2 <= 10^9
 * 	xi1 <= xi2
 * 	yi1 <= yi2
