 *
 * Given a string s. Return all the words vertically in the same order in which they appear in s.<br />
 * Words are returned as a list of strings, complete with spaces when is necessary. (Trailing spaces are not allowed).<br />
 * Each word would be put on only one column and that in one column there will be only one word.
 * 
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "HOW ARE YOU"
 * Output: ["HAY","ORO","WEU"]
 * Explanation: Each word is printed vertically.
