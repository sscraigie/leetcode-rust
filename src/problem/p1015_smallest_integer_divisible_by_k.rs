/**
 * [1015] Smallest Integer Divisible by K
 *
 * Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.
 * Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.
 * Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: k = 1
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: k = 2
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: k = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= k <= 10^5
 *
