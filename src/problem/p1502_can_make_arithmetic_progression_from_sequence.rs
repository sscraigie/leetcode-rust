/**
 * [1502] Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence
 *
 * A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
 * Given an array of numbers arr, return true if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression. Otherwise, return false.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: arr = [3,5,1]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: arr = [1,2,4]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	2 <= arr.length <= 1000
 * 	-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
 *
