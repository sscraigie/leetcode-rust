/**
 * [89] Gray Code
 *
 * An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of 2^n integers where:
 * 
 * 	Every integer is in the inclusive range [0, 2^n - 1],
 * 	The first integer is 0,
 * 	An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,
 * 	The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and
 * 	The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.
 * 
 * Given an integer n, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: [0,1,3,2]
 * Explanation:
 * The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
 * - 0<u>0</u> and 0<u>1</u> differ by one bit
 * - <u>0</u>1 and <u>1</u>1 differ by one bit
 * - 1<u>1</u> and 1<u>0</u> differ by one bit
 * - <u>1</u>0 and <u>0</u>0 differ by one bit
 * [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
 * - <u>0</u>0 and <u>1</u>0 differ by one bit
 * - 1<u>0</u> and 1<u>1</u> differ by one bit
 * - <u>1</u>1 and <u>0</u>1 differ by one bit
 * - 0<u>1</u> and 0<u>0</u> differ by one bit
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: [0,1]
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 16
