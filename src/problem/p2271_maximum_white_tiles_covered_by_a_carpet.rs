/**
 * [2271] Maximum White Tiles Covered by a Carpet
 *
 * You are given a 2D integer array tiles where tiles[i] = [li, ri] represents that every tile j in the range li <= j <= ri is colored white.
 * You are also given an integer carpetLen, the length of a single carpet that can be placed anywhere.
 * Return the maximum number of white tiles that can be covered by the carpet.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/25/example1drawio3.png" style="width: 644px; height: 158px;" />
 * Input: tiles = [[1,5],[10,11],[12,18],[20,25],[30,32]], carpetLen = 10
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation: Place the carpet starting on tile 10. 
 * It covers 9 white tiles, so we return 9.
 * Note that there may be other places where the carpet covers 9 white tiles.
 * It can be shown that the carpet cannot cover more than 9 white tiles.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/24/example2drawio.png" style="width: 231px; height: 168px;" />
 * Input: tiles = [[10,11],[1,1]], carpetLen = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Place the carpet starting on tile 10. 
 * It covers 2 white tiles, so we return 2.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= tiles.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * 	tiles[i].length == 2
 * 	1 <= li <= ri <= 10^9
 * 	1 <= carpetLen <= 10^9
 * 	The tiles are non-overlapping.
