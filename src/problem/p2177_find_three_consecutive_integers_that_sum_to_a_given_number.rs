/**
 * [2177] Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number
 *
 * Given an integer num, return three consecutive integers (as a sorted array) that sum to num. If num cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return an empty array.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: num = 33
 * Output: [10,11,12]
 * Explanation: 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.
 * 10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: num = 4
 * Output: []
 * Explanation: There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	0 <= num <= 10^15
 *
