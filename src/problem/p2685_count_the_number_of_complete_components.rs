/**
 * [2685] Count the Number of Complete Components
 *
 * You are given an integer n. There is an undirected graph with n vertices, numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting vertices ai and bi.
 * Return the number of complete connected components of the graph.
 * A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.
 * A connected component is said to be complete if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <strong class="example"><img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/04/11/screenshot-from-2023-04-11-23-31-23.png" style="width: 671px; height: 270px;" />
 * 
 * Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: From the picture above, one can see that all of the components of this graph are complete.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <strong class="example"><img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/04/11/screenshot-from-2023-04-11-23-32-00.png" style="width: 671px; height: 270px;" />
 * 
 * Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The component containing vertices 0, 1, and 2 is complete since there is an edge between every pair of two vertices. On the other hand, the component containing vertices 3, 4, and 5 is not complete since there is no edge between vertices 4 and 5. Thus, the number of complete components in this graph is 1.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 50
 * 	0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
 * 	edges[i].length == 2
 * 	0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
 * 	ai != bi
 * 	There are no repeated edges.
