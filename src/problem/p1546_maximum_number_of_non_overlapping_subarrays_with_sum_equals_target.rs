/**
 * [1546] Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Subarrays With Sum Equals Target
 *
 * Given an array nums and an integer target, return the maximum number of non-empty non-overlapping subarrays such that the sum of values in each subarray is equal to target.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are 2 non-overlapping subarrays [1,1,1,1,1] with sum equals to target(2).
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [-1,3,5,1,4,2,-9], target = 6
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are 3 subarrays with sum equal to 6.
 * ([5,1], [4,2], [3,5,1,4,2,-9]) but only the first 2 are non-overlapping.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * 	-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 * 	0 <= target <= 10^6
 *
