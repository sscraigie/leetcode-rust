/**
 * [2344] Minimum Deletions to Make Array Divisible
 *
 * You are given two positive integer arrays nums and numsDivide. You can delete any number of elements from nums.
 * Return the minimum number of deletions such that the smallest element in nums divides all the elements of numsDivide. If this is not possible, return -1.
 * Note that an integer x divides y if y % x == 0.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,3,2,4,3], numsDivide = [9,6,9,3,15]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 
 * The smallest element in [2,3,2,4,3] is 2, which does not divide all the elements of numsDivide.
 * We use 2 deletions to delete the elements in nums that are equal to 2 which makes nums = [3,4,3].
 * The smallest element in [3,4,3] is 3, which divides all the elements of numsDivide.
 * It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of deletions needed.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [4,3,6], numsDivide = [8,2,6,10]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: 
 * We want the smallest element in nums to divide all the elements of numsDivide.
 * There is no way to delete elements from nums to allow this.
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length, numsDivide.length <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= nums[i], numsDivide[i] <= 10^9
 *
