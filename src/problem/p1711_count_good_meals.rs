/**
 * [1711] Count Good Meals
 *
 * A good meal is a meal that contains exactly two different food items with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.
 * You can pick any two different foods to make a good meal.
 * Given an array of integers deliciousness where deliciousness[i] is the deliciousness of the i^​​​​​​th​​​​​​​​ item of food, return the number of different good meals you can make from this list modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * Note that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: deliciousness = [1,3,5,7,9]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The good meals are (1,3), (1,7), (3,5) and, (7,9).
 * Their respective sums are 4, 8, 8, and 16, all of which are powers of 2.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: deliciousness = [1,1,1,3,3,3,7]
 * Output: 15
 * Explanation: The good meals are (1,1) with 3 ways, (1,3) with 9 ways, and (1,7) with 3 ways.
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= deliciousness.length <= 10^5
 * 	0 <= deliciousness[i] <= 2^20
 *
