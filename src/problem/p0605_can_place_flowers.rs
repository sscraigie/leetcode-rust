/**
 * [605] Can Place Flowers
 *
 * You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.
 * Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
 * Output: true
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
 * Output: false
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10^4
 * 	flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
 * 	There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
 * 	0 <= n <= flowerbed.length
 *
