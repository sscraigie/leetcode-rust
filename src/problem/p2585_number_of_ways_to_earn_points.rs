/**
 * [2585] Number of Ways to Earn Points
 *
 * There is a test that has n types of questions. You are given an integer target and a 0-indexed 2D integer array types where types[i] = [counti, marksi] indicates that there are counti questions of the i^th type, and each one of them is worth marksi points.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the number of ways you can earn exactly target points in the exam. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * Note that questions of the same type are indistinguishable.
 * 
 * 	For example, if there are 3 questions of the same type, then solving the 1^st and 2^nd questions is the same as solving the 1^st and 3^rd questions, or the 2^nd and 3^rd questions.
 * 
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: target = 6, types = [[6,1],[3,2],[2,3]]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: You can earn 6 points in one of the seven ways:
 * - Solve 6 questions of the 0^th type: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6
 * - Solve 4 questions of the 0^th type and 1 question of the 1^st type: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6
 * - Solve 2 questions of the 0^th type and 2 questions of the 1^st type: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6
 * - Solve 3 questions of the 0^th type and 1 question of the 2^nd type: 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6
 * - Solve 1 question of the 0^th type, 1 question of the 1^st type and 1 question of the 2^nd type: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
 * - Solve 3 questions of the 1^st type: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
 * - Solve 2 questions of the 2^nd type: 3 + 3 = 6
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: target = 5, types = [[50,1],[50,2],[50,5]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: You can earn 5 points in one of the four ways:
 * - Solve 5 questions of the 0^th type: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
 * - Solve 3 questions of the 0^th type and 1 question of the 1^st type: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5
 * - Solve 1 questions of the 0^th type and 2 questions of the 1^st type: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5
 * - Solve 1 question of the 2^nd type: 5
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: target = 18, types = [[6,1],[3,2],[2,3]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: You can only earn 18 points by answering all questions.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= target <= 1000
 * 	n == types.length
 * 	1 <= n <= 50
 * 	types[i].length == 2
 * 	1 <= counti, marksi <= 50
