/**
 * [2405] Optimal Partition of String
 *
 * Given a string s, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than once.
 * Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.
 * Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "abacaba"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation:
 * Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
 * It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "ssssss"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation:
 * The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * 	s consists of only English lowercase letters.
