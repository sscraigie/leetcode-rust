/**
 * [1528] Shuffle String
 *
 * You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the i^th position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.
 * Return the shuffled string.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/09/q1.jpg" style="width: 321px; height: 243px;" />
 * Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
 * Output: "leetcode"
 * Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
 * Output: "abc"
 * Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	s.length == indices.length == n
 * 	1 <= n <= 100
 * 	s consists of only lowercase English letters.
 * 	0 <= indices[i] < n
 * 	All values of indices are unique.
