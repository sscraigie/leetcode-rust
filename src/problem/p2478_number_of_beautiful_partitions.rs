/**
 * [2478] Number of Beautiful Partitions
 *
 * You are given a string s that consists of the digits '1' to '9' and two integers k and minLength.
 * A partition of s is called beautiful if:
 * 
 * 	s is partitioned into k non-intersecting substrings.
 * 	Each substring has a length of at least minLength.
 * 	Each substring starts with a prime digit and ends with a non-prime digit. Prime digits are '2', '3', '5', and '7', and the rest of the digits are non-prime.
 * 
 * Return the number of beautiful partitions of s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "23542185131", k = 3, minLength = 2
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: There exists three ways to create a beautiful partition:
 * "2354 | 218 | 5131"
 * "2354 | 21851 | 31"
 * "2354218 | 51 | 31"
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "23542185131", k = 3, minLength = 3
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: There exists one way to create a beautiful partition: "2354 | 218 | 5131".
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: s = "3312958", k = 3, minLength = 1
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: There exists one way to create a beautiful partition: "331 | 29 | 58".
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= k, minLength <= s.length <= 1000
 * 	s consists of the digits '1' to '9'.
