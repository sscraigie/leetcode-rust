/**
 * [227] Basic Calculator II
 *
 * Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value. 
 * The integer division should truncate toward zero.
 * You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-2^31, 2^31 - 1].
 * Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * Input: s = "3+2*2"
 * Output: 7
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * Input: s = " 3/2 "
 * Output: 1
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
 * Output: 5
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5
 * 	s consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by some number of spaces.
 * 	s represents a valid expression.
 * 	All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 2^31 - 1].
 * 	The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
