/**
 * [16] 3Sum Closest
 *
 * Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
 * Return the sum of the three integers.
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	3 <= nums.length <= 500
 * 	-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
 * 	-10^4 <= target <= 10^4
 *
