/**
 * [1221] Split a String in Balanced Strings
 *
 * Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.
 * Given a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:
 * 
 * 	Each substring is balanced.
 * 
 * Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
 * Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2^nd and 5^th substrings are not balanced.
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	2 <= s.length <= 1000
 * 	s[i] is either 'L' or 'R'.
 * 	s is a balanced string.
 *
