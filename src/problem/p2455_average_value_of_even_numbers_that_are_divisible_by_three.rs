/**
 * [2455] Average Value of Even Numbers That Are Divisible by Three
 *
 * Given an integer array nums of positive integers, return the average value of all even integers that are divisible by 3.
 * Note that the average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and rounded down to the nearest integer.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,3,6,10,12,15]
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation: 6 and 12 are even numbers that are divisible by 3. (6 + 12) / 2 = 9.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,4,7,10]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There is no single number that satisfies the requirement, so return 0.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * 	1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
 *
