/**
 * [2369] Check if There is a Valid Partition For The Array
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. You have to partition the array into one or more contiguous subarrays.
 * We call a partition of the array valid if each of the obtained subarrays satisfies one of the following conditions:
 * <ol>
 * 	The subarray consists of exactly 2 equal elements. For example, the subarray [2,2] is good.
 * 	The subarray consists of exactly 3 equal elements. For example, the subarray [4,4,4] is good.
 * 	The subarray consists of exactly 3 consecutive increasing elements, that is, the difference between adjacent elements is 1. For example, the subarray [3,4,5] is good, but the subarray [1,3,5] is not.
 * </ol>
 * Return true if the array has at least one valid partition. Otherwise, return false.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [4,4,4,5,6]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The array can be partitioned into the subarrays [4,4] and [4,5,6].
 * This partition is valid, so we return true.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,1,1,2]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no valid partition for this array.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
 *
