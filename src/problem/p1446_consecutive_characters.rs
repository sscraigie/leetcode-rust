/**
 * [1446] Consecutive Characters
 *
 * The power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.
 * Given a string s, return the power of s.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "leetcode"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= s.length <= 500
 * 	s consists of only lowercase English letters.
