/**
 * [2390] Removing Stars From a String
 *
 * You are given a string s, which contains stars *.
 * In one operation, you can:
 * 
 * 	Choose a star in s.
 * 	Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.
 * 
 * Return the string after all stars have been removed.
 * Note:
 * 
 * 	The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
 * 	It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.
 * 
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
 * Output: "lecoe"
 * Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
 * - The closest character to the 1^st star is 't' in "lee<u>t</u>**cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
 * - The closest character to the 2^nd star is 'e' in "le<u>e</u>*cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
 * - The closest character to the 3^rd star is 'd' in "leco<u>d</u>*e". s becomes "lecoe".
 * There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "erase*****"
 * Output: ""
 * Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * 	s consists of lowercase English letters and stars *.
 * 	The operation above can be performed on s.
 *
