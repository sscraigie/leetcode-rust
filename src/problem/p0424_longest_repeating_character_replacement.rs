/**
 * [424] Longest Repeating Character Replacement
 *
 * You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.
 * Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
 * The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
 * There may exists other ways to achive this answer too.
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * 	s consists of only uppercase English letters.
 * 	0 <= k <= s.length
 *
