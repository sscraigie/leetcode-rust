/**
 * [2530] Maximal Score After Applying K Operations
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. You have a starting score of 0.
 * In one operation:
 * <ol>
 * 	choose an index i such that 0 <= i < nums.length,
 * 	increase your score by nums[i], and
 * 	replace nums[i] with ceil(nums[i] / 3).
 * </ol>
 * Return the maximum possible score you can attain after applying exactly k operations.
 * The ceiling function ceil(val) is the least integer greater than or equal to val.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [10,10,10,10,10], k = 5
 * Output: 50
 * Explanation: Apply the operation to each array element exactly once. The final score is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,10,3,3,3], k = 3
 * Output: 17
 * Explanation: You can do the following operations:
 * Operation 1: Select i = 1, so nums becomes [1,<u>4</u>,3,3,3]. Your score increases by 10.
 * Operation 2: Select i = 1, so nums becomes [1,<u>2</u>,3,3,3]. Your score increases by 4.
 * Operation 3: Select i = 2, so nums becomes [1,1,<u>1</u>,3,3]. Your score increases by 3.
 * The final score is 10 + 4 + 3 = 17.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length, k <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 *
