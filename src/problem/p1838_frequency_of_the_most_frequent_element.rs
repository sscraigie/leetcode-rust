/**
 * [1838] Frequency of the Most Frequent Element
 *
 * The frequency of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.
 * You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. In one operation, you can choose an index of nums and increment the element at that index by 1.
 * Return the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most k operations.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4].
 * 4 has a frequency of 3.
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are multiple optimal solutions:
 * - Increment the first element three times to make nums = [4,4,8,13]. 4 has a frequency of 2.
 * - Increment the second element four times to make nums = [1,8,8,13]. 8 has a frequency of 2.
 * - Increment the third element five times to make nums = [1,4,13,13]. 13 has a frequency of 2.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,9,6], k = 2
 * Output: 1
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= k <= 10^5
 *
