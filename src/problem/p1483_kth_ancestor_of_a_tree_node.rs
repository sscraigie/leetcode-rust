/**
 * [1483] Kth Ancestor of a Tree Node
 *
 * You are given a tree with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 in the form of a parent array parent where parent[i] is the parent of i^th node. The root of the tree is node 0. Find the k^th ancestor of a given node.
 * The k^th ancestor of a tree node is the k^th node in the path from that node to the root node.
 * Implement the TreeAncestor class:
 * 
 * 	TreeAncestor(int n, int[] parent) Initializes the object with the number of nodes in the tree and the parent array.
 * 	int getKthAncestor(int node, int k) return the k^th ancestor of the given node node. If there is no such ancestor, return -1.
 * 
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/28/1528_ex1.png" style="width: 396px; height: 262px;" />
 * Input
 * ["TreeAncestor", "getKthAncestor", "getKthAncestor", "getKthAncestor"]
 * [[7, [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]], [3, 1], [5, 2], [6, 3]]
 * Output
 * [null, 1, 0, -1]
 * Explanation
 * TreeAncestor treeAncestor = new TreeAncestor(7, [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]);
 * treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(3, 1); // returns 1 which is the parent of 3
 * treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(5, 2); // returns 0 which is the grandparent of 5
 * treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(6, 3); // returns -1 because there is no such ancestor
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= k <= n <= 5 * 10^4
 * 	parent.length == n
 * 	parent[0] == -1
 * 	0 <= parent[i] < n for all 0 < i < n
 * 	0 <= node < n
 * 	There will be at most 5 * 10^4 queries.
