/**
 * [2458] Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries
 *
 * You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from 1 to n. You are also given an array queries of size m.
 * You have to perform m independent queries on the tree where in the i^th query you do the following:
 * 
 * 	Remove the subtree rooted at the node with the value queries[i] from the tree. It is guaranteed that queries[i] will not be equal to the value of the root.
 * 
 * Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the height of the tree after performing the i^th query.
 * Note:
 * 
 * 	The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its initial state after each query.
 * 	The height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest simple path from the root to some node in the tree.
 * 
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/07/binaryytreeedrawio-1.png" style="width: 495px; height: 281px;" />
 * Input: root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7], queries = [4]
 * Output: [2]
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.
 * The height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/07/binaryytreeedrawio-2.png" style="width: 301px; height: 284px;" />
 * Input: root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6], queries = [3,2,4,8]
 * Output: [3,2,3,2]
 * Explanation: We have the following queries:
 * - Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 3. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4).
 * - Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 2. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 1).
 * - Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6).
 * - Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 8. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 9 -> 3).
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	The number of nodes in the tree is n.
 * 	2 <= n <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= Node.val <= n
 * 	All the values in the tree are unique.
 * 	m == queries.length
 * 	1 <= m <= min(n, 10^4)
 * 	1 <= queries[i] <= n
 * 	queries[i] != root.val
 *
