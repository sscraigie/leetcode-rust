/**
 * [2290] Minimum Obstacle Removal to Reach Corner
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array grid of size m x n. Each cell has one of two values:
 * 
 * 	0 represents an empty cell,
 * 	1 represents an obstacle that may be removed.
 * 
 * You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell.
 * Return the minimum number of obstacles to remove so you can move from the upper left corner (0, 0) to the lower right corner (m - 1, n - 1).
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/04/06/example1drawio-1.png" style="width: 605px; height: 246px;" />
 * Input: grid = [[0,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: We can remove the obstacles at (0, 1) and (0, 2) to create a path from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
 * It can be shown that we need to remove at least 2 obstacles, so we return 2.
 * Note that there may be other ways to remove 2 obstacles to create a path.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/04/06/example1drawio.png" style="width: 405px; height: 246px;" />
 * Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1,0]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: We can move from (0, 0) to (2, 4) without removing any obstacles, so we return 0.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	m == grid.length
 * 	n == grid[i].length
 * 	1 <= m, n <= 10^5
 * 	2 <= m * n <= 10^5
 * 	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
 * 	grid[0][0] == grid[m - 1][n - 1] == 0
 *
