/**
 * [414] Third Maximum Number
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,2,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * The first distinct maximum is 3.
 * The second distinct maximum is 2.
 * The third distinct maximum is 1.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * The first distinct maximum is 2.
 * The second distinct maximum is 1.
 * The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * The first distinct maximum is 3.
 * The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
 * The third distinct maximum is 1.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
 * 	-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
 * 
 *  
 * Follow up: Can you find an O(n) solution?
