/**
 * [2484] Count Palindromic Subsequences
 *
 * Given a string of digits s, return the number of palindromic subsequences of s having length 5. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * Note:
 * 
 * 	A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
 * 	A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
 * 
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "103301"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 
 * There are 6 possible subsequences of length 5: "10330","10331","10301","10301","13301","03301". 
 * Two of them (both equal to "10301") are palindromic.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "0000000"
 * Output: 21
 * Explanation: All 21 subsequences are "00000", which is palindromic.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: s = "9999900000"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The only two palindromic subsequences are "99999" and "00000".
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= s.length <= 10^4
 * 	s consists of digits.
