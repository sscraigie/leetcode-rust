/**
 * [922] Sort Array By Parity II
 *
 * Given an array of integers nums, half of the integers in nums are odd, and the other half are even.
 * Sort the array so that whenever nums[i] is odd, i is odd, and whenever nums[i] is even, i is even.
 * Return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [4,2,5,7]
 * Output: [4,5,2,7]
 * Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,3]
 * Output: [2,3]
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
 * 	nums.length is even.
 * 	Half of the integers in nums are even.
 * 	0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
 * 
 *  
 * Follow Up: Could you solve it in-place?
