/**
 * [884] Uncommon Words from Two Sentences
 *
 * A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.
 * A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.
 * Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"
 * Output: ["sweet","sour"]
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * Input: s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"
 * Output: ["banana"]
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 200
 * 	s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.
 * 	s1 and s2 do not have leading or trailing spaces.
 * 	All the words in s1 and s2 are separated by a single space.
