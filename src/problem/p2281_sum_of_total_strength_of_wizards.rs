/**
 * [2281] Sum of Total Strength of Wizards
 *
 * As the ruler of a kingdom, you have an army of wizards at your command.
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array strength, where strength[i] denotes the strength of the i^th wizard. For a contiguous group of wizards (i.e. the wizards' strengths form a subarray of strength), the total strength is defined as the product of the following two values:
 * 
 * 	The strength of the weakest wizard in the group.
 * 	The total of all the individual strengths of the wizards in the group.
 * 
 * Return the sum of the total strengths of all contiguous groups of wizards. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: strength = [1,3,1,2]
 * Output: 44
 * Explanation: The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards:
 * - [1] from [<u>1</u>,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1]) * sum([1]) = 1 * 1 = 1
 * - [3] from [1,<u>3</u>,1,2] has a total strength of min([3]) * sum([3]) = 3 * 3 = 9
 * - [1] from [1,3,<u>1</u>,2] has a total strength of min([1]) * sum([1]) = 1 * 1 = 1
 * - [2] from [1,3,1,<u>2</u>] has a total strength of min([2]) * sum([2]) = 2 * 2 = 4
 * - [1,3] from [<u>1,3</u>,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,3]) * sum([1,3]) = 1 * 4 = 4
 * - [3,1] from [1,<u>3,1</u>,2] has a total strength of min([3,1]) * sum([3,1]) = 1 * 4 = 4
 * - [1,2] from [1,3,<u>1,2</u>] has a total strength of min([1,2]) * sum([1,2]) = 1 * 3 = 3
 * - [1,3,1] from [<u>1,3,1</u>,2] has a total strength of min([1,3,1]) * sum([1,3,1]) = 1 * 5 = 5
 * - [3,1,2] from [1,<u>3,1,2</u>] has a total strength of min([3,1,2]) * sum([3,1,2]) = 1 * 6 = 6
 * - [1,3,1,2] from [<u>1,3,1,2</u>] has a total strength of min([1,3,1,2]) * sum([1,3,1,2]) = 1 * 7 = 7
 * The sum of all the total strengths is 1 + 9 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 44.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: strength = [5,4,6]
 * Output: 213
 * Explanation: The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards: 
 * - [5] from [<u>5</u>,4,6] has a total strength of min([5]) * sum([5]) = 5 * 5 = 25
 * - [4] from [5,<u>4</u>,6] has a total strength of min([4]) * sum([4]) = 4 * 4 = 16
 * - [6] from [5,4,<u>6</u>] has a total strength of min([6]) * sum([6]) = 6 * 6 = 36
 * - [5,4] from [<u>5,4</u>,6] has a total strength of min([5,4]) * sum([5,4]) = 4 * 9 = 36
 * - [4,6] from [5,<u>4,6</u>] has a total strength of min([4,6]) * sum([4,6]) = 4 * 10 = 40
 * - [5,4,6] from [<u>5,4,6</u>] has a total strength of min([5,4,6]) * sum([5,4,6]) = 4 * 15 = 60
 * The sum of all the total strengths is 25 + 16 + 36 + 36 + 40 + 60 = 213.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= strength.length <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= strength[i] <= 10^9
