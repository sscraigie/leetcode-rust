/**
 * [2332] The Latest Time to Catch a Bus
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array buses of length n, where buses[i] represents the departure time of the i^th bus. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array passengers of length m, where passengers[j] represents the arrival time of the j^th passenger. All bus departure times are unique. All passenger arrival times are unique.
 * You are given an integer capacity, which represents the maximum number of passengers that can get on each bus.
 * When a passenger arrives, they will wait in line for the next available bus. You can get on a bus that departs at x minutes if you arrive at y minutes where y <= x, and the bus is not full. Passengers with the earliest arrival times get on the bus first.
 * More formally when a bus arrives, either:
 * 
 * 	If capacity or fewer passengers are waiting for a bus, they will all get on the bus, or
 * 	The capacity passengers with the earliest arrival times will get on the bus.
 * 
 * Return the latest time you may arrive at the bus station to catch a bus. You cannot arrive at the same time as another passenger.
 * Note: The arrays buses and passengers are not necessarily sorted.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: buses = [10,20], passengers = [2,17,18,19], capacity = 2
 * Output: 16
 * Explanation: Suppose you arrive at time 16.
 * At time 10, the first bus departs with the 0^th passenger. 
 * At time 20, the second bus departs with you and the 1^st passenger.
 * Note that you may not arrive at the same time as another passenger, which is why you must arrive before the 1^st passenger to catch the bus.
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: buses = [20,30,10], passengers = [19,13,26,4,25,11,21], capacity = 2
 * Output: 20
 * Explanation: Suppose you arrive at time 20.
 * At time 10, the first bus departs with the 3^rd passenger. 
 * At time 20, the second bus departs with the 5^th and 1^st passengers.
 * At time 30, the third bus departs with the 0^th passenger and you.
 * Notice if you had arrived any later, then the 6^th passenger would have taken your seat on the third bus.
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	n == buses.length
 * 	m == passengers.length
 * 	1 <= n, m, capacity <= 10^5
 * 	2 <= buses[i], passengers[i] <= 10^9
 * 	Each element in buses is unique.
 * 	Each element in passengers is unique.
