/**
 * [2651] Calculate Delayed Arrival Time
 *
 * You are given a positive integer arrivalTime denoting the arrival time of a train in hours, and another positive integer delayedTime denoting the amount of delay in hours.
 * Return the time when the train will arrive at the station.
 * Note that the time in this problem is in 24-hours format.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: arrivalTime = 15, delayedTime = 5 
 * Output: 20 
 * Explanation: Arrival time of the train was 15:00 hours. It is delayed by 5 hours. Now it will reach at 15+5 = 20 (20:00 hours).
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: arrivalTime = 13, delayedTime = 11
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: Arrival time of the train was 13:00 hours. It is delayed by 11 hours. Now it will reach at 13+11=24 (Which is denoted by 00:00 in 24 hours format so return 0).
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= arrivaltime < 24
 * 	1 <= delayedTime <= 24
 *
