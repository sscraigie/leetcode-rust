/**
 * [2384] Largest Palindromic Number
 *
 * You are given a string num consisting of digits only.
 * Return the largest palindromic integer (in the form of a string) that can be formed using digits taken from num. It should not contain leading zeroes.
 * Notes:
 * 
 * 	You do not need to use all the digits of num, but you must use at least one digit.
 * 	The digits can be reordered.
 * 
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: num = "444947137"
 * Output: "7449447"
 * Explanation: 
 * Use the digits "4449477" from "<u>44494</u><u>7</u>13<u>7</u>" to form the palindromic integer "7449447".
 * It can be shown that "7449447" is the largest palindromic integer that can be formed.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: num = "00009"
 * Output: "9"
 * Explanation: 
 * It can be shown that "9" is the largest palindromic integer that can be formed.
 * Note that the integer returned should not contain leading zeroes.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= num.length <= 10^5
 * 	num consists of digits.
 *
