/**
 * [673] Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.
 * Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 increasing subsequences of length 1, so output 5.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 2000
 * 	-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
 *
