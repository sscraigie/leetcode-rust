/**
 * [56] Merge Intervals
 *
 * Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 * Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 * Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
 * Output: [[1,5]]
 * Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
 * 	intervals[i].length == 2
 * 	0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4
 *
