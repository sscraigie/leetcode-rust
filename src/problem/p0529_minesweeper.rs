/**
 * [529] Minesweeper
 *
 * Let's play the minesweeper game (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://minesweeperonline.com" target="_blank">online game</a>)!
 * You are given an m x n char matrix board representing the game board where:
 * 
 * 	'M' represents an unrevealed mine,
 * 	'E' represents an unrevealed empty square,
 * 	'B' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),
 * 	digit ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
 * 	'X' represents a revealed mine.
 * 
 * You are also given an integer array click where click = [clickr, clickc] represents the next click position among all the unrevealed squares ('M' or 'E').
 * Return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:
 * <ol>
 * 	If a mine 'M' is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to 'X'.
 * 	If an empty square 'E' with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank 'B' and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
 * 	If an empty square 'E' with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.
 * 	Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.
 * </ol>
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/09/untitled.jpeg" style="width: 500px; max-width: 400px; height: 269px;" />
 * Input: board = [["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","M","E","E"],["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","E","E","E"]], click = [3,0]
 * Output: [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","M","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]]
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/09/untitled-2.jpeg" style="width: 489px; max-width: 400px; height: 269px;" />
 * Input: board = [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","M","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]], click = [1,2]
 * Output: [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","X","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]]
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	m == board.length
 * 	n == board[i].length
 * 	1 <= m, n <= 50
 * 	board[i][j] is either 'M', 'E', 'B', or a digit from '1' to '8'.
 * 	click.length == 2
 * 	0 <= clickr < m
 * 	0 <= clickc < n
 * 	board[clickr][clickc] is either 'M' or 'E'.
