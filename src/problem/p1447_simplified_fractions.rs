/**
 * [1447] Simplified Fractions
 *
 * Given an integer n, return a list of all simplified fractions between 0 and 1 (exclusive) such that the denominator is less-than-or-equal-to n. You can return the answer in any order.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: ["1/2"]
 * Explanation: "1/2" is the only unique fraction with a denominator less-than-or-equal-to 2.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 3
 * Output: ["1/2","1/3","2/3"]
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: n = 4
 * Output: ["1/2","1/3","1/4","2/3","3/4"]
 * Explanation: "2/4" is not a simplified fraction because it can be simplified to "1/2".
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 100
 *
