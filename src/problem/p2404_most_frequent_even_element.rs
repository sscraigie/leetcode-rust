/**
 * [2404] Most Frequent Even Element
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the most frequent even element.
 * If there is a tie, return the smallest one. If there is no such element, return -1.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,4,4,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * The even elements are 0, 2, and 4. Of these, 2 and 4 appear the most.
 * We return the smallest one, which is 2.
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [4,4,4,9,2,4]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: 4 is the even element appears the most.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [29,47,21,41,13,37,25,7]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There is no even element.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 2000
 * 	0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
 *
