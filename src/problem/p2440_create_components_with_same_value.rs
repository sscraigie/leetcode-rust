/**
 * [2440] Create Components With Same Value
 *
 * There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array <font face="monospace">nums</font> of length n where nums[i] represents the value of the i^th node. You are also given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
 * You are allowed to delete some edges, splitting the tree into multiple connected components. Let the value of a component be the sum of all nums[i] for which node i is in the component.
 * Return the maximum number of edges you can delete, such that every connected component in the tree has the same value.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/26/diagramdrawio.png" style="width: 441px; height: 351px;" />
 * Input: nums = [6,2,2,2,6], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]] 
 * Output: 2 
 * Explanation: The above figure shows how we can delete the edges [0,1] and [3,4]. The created components are nodes [0], [1,2,3] and [4]. The sum of the values in each component equals 6. It can be proven that no better deletion exists, so the answer is 2.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2], edges = []
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There are no edges to be deleted.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
 * 	nums.length == n
 * 	1 <= nums[i] <= 50
 * 	edges.length == n - 1
 * 	edges[i].length == 2
 * 	0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n - 1
 * 	edges represents a valid tree.
