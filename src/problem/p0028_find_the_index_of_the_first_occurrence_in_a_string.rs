/**
 * [28] Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
 *
 * Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
 * The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4
 * 	haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
 *
