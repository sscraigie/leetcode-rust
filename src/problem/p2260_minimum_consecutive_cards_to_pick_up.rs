/**
 * [2260] Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up
 *
 * You are given an integer array cards where cards[i] represents the value of the i^th card. A pair of cards are matching if the cards have the same value.
 * Return the minimum number of consecutive cards you have to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards. If it is impossible to have matching cards, return -1.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: cards = [1,0,5,3]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= cards.length <= 10^5
 * 	0 <= cards[i] <= 10^6
 *
