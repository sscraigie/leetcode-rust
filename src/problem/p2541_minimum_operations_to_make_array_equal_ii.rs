/**
 * [2541] Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal II
 *
 * You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of equal length n and an integer k. You can perform the following operation on nums1:
 * 
 * 	Choose two indexes i and j and increment nums1[i] by k and decrement nums1[j] by k. In other words, nums1[i] = nums1[i] + k and nums1[j] = nums1[j] - k.
 * 
 * nums1 is said to be equal to nums2 if for all indices i such that 0 <= i < n, nums1[i] == nums2[i].
 * Return the minimum number of operations required to make nums1 equal to nums2. If it is impossible to make them equal, return -1.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums1 = [4,3,1,4], nums2 = [1,3,7,1], k = 3
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: In 2 operations, we can transform nums1 to nums2.
 * 1^st operation: i = 2, j = 0. After applying the operation, nums1 = [1,3,4,4].
 * 2^nd operation: i = 2, j = 3. After applying the operation, nums1 = [1,3,7,1].
 * One can prove that it is impossible to make arrays equal in fewer operations.
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums1 = [3,8,5,2], nums2 = [2,4,1,6], k = 1
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: It can be proved that it is impossible to make the two arrays equal.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	n == nums1.length == nums2.length
 * 	2 <= n <= 10^5
 * 	0 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9
 * 	0 <= k <= 10^5
 *
