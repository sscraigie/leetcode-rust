/**
 * [264] Ugly Number II
 *
 * An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
 * Given an integer n, return the n^th ugly number.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 10
 * Output: 12
 * Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 1690
 *
