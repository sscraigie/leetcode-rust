/**
 * [1979] Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the greatest common divisor of the smallest number and largest number in nums.
 * The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * The smallest number in nums is 2.
 * The largest number in nums is 10.
 * The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [7,5,6,8,3]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * The smallest number in nums is 3.
 * The largest number in nums is 8.
 * The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,3]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * The smallest number in nums is 3.
 * The largest number in nums is 3.
 * The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	2 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * 	1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
 *
