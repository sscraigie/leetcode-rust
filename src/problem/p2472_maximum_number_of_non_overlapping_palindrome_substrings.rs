/**
 * [2472] Maximum Number of Non-overlapping Palindrome Substrings
 *
 * You are given a string s and a positive integer k.
 * Select a set of non-overlapping substrings from the string s that satisfy the following conditions:
 * 
 * 	The length of each substring is at least k.
 * 	Each substring is a palindrome.
 * 
 * Return the maximum number of substrings in an optimal selection.
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "abaccdbbd", k = 3
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: We can select the substrings underlined in s = "<u>aba</u>cc<u>dbbd</u>". Both "aba" and "dbbd" are palindromes and have a length of at least k = 3.
 * It can be shown that we cannot find a selection with more than two valid substrings.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "adbcda", k = 2
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There is no palindrome substring of length at least 2 in the string.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= k <= s.length <= 2000
 * 	s consists of lowercase English letters.
