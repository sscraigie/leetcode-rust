/**
 * [2536] Increment Submatrices by One
 *
 * You are given a positive integer n, indicating that we initially have an n x n 0-indexed integer matrix mat filled with zeroes.
 * You are also given a 2D integer array query. For each query[i] = [row1i, col1i, row2i, col2i], you should do the following operation:
 * 
 * 	Add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (row1i, col1i) and the bottom right corner (row2i, col2i). That is, add 1 to mat[x][y] for all row1i <= x <= row2i and col1i <= y <= col2i.
 * 
 * Return the matrix mat after performing every query.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/11/24/p2example11.png" style="width: 531px; height: 121px;" />
 * Input: n = 3, queries = [[1,1,2,2],[0,0,1,1]]
 * Output: [[1,1,0],[1,2,1],[0,1,1]]
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial matrix, the matrix after the first query, and the matrix after the second query.
 * - In the first query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (1, 1) and bottom right corner (2, 2).
 * - In the second query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (0, 0) and bottom right corner (1, 1).
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/11/24/p2example22.png" style="width: 261px; height: 82px;" />
 * Input: n = 2, queries = [[0,0,1,1]]
 * Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
 * Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial matrix and the matrix after the first query.
 * - In the first query we add 1 to every element in the matrix.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 500
 * 	1 <= queries.length <= 10^4
 * 	0 <= row1i <= row2i < n
 * 	0 <= col1i <= col2i < n
 *
