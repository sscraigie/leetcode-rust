/**
 * [1262] Greatest Sum Divisible by Three
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,6,5,1,8]
 * Output: 18
 * Explanation: Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [4]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
 * Output: 12
 * Explanation: Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 10^4
 * 	1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 *
