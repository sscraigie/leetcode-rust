/**
 * [63] Unique Paths II
 *
 * You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
 * An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.
 * Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
 * The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot1.jpg" style="width: 242px; height: 242px;" />
 * Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
 * There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
 * 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
 * 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot2.jpg" style="width: 162px; height: 162px;" />
 * Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	m == obstacleGrid.length
 * 	n == obstacleGrid[i].length
 * 	1 <= m, n <= 100
 * 	obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
