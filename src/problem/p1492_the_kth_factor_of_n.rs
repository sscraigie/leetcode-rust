/**
 * [1492] The kth Factor of n
 *
 * You are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.
 * Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the k^th factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 12, k = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3^rd factor is 3.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 7, k = 2
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Factors list is [1, 7], the 2^nd factor is 7.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, k = 4
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4], there is only 3 factors. We should return -1.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= k <= n <= 1000
 * 
 *  
 * Follow up:
 * Could you solve this problem in less than O(n) complexity?
 *
