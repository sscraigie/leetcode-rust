/**
 * [1374] Generate a String With Characters That Have Odd Counts
 *
 * Given an integer n, return a string with n characters such that each character in such string occurs an odd number of times.
 * The returned string must contain only lowercase English letters. If there are multiples valid strings, return any of them.  
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 4
 * Output: "pppz"
 * Explanation: "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: "xy"
 * Explanation: "xy" is a valid string since the characters 'x' and 'y' occur once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ag" and "ur".
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: n = 7
 * Output: "holasss"
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 500
 *
