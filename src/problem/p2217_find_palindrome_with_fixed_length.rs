/**
 * [2217] Find Palindrome With Fixed Length
 *
 * Given an integer array queries and a positive integer intLength, return an array answer where answer[i] is either the queries[i]^th smallest positive palindrome of length intLength or -1 if no such palindrome exists.
 * A palindrome is a number that reads the same backwards and forwards. Palindromes cannot have leading zeros.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: queries = [1,2,3,4,5,90], intLength = 3
 * Output: [101,111,121,131,141,999]
 * Explanation:
 * The first few palindromes of length 3 are:
 * 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, ...
 * The 90^th palindrome of length 3 is 999.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: queries = [2,4,6], intLength = 4
 * Output: [1111,1331,1551]
 * Explanation:
 * The first six palindromes of length 4 are:
 * 1001, 1111, 1221, 1331, 1441, and 1551.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * 	1 <= queries[i] <= 10^9
 * 	1 <= intLength <= 15
 *
