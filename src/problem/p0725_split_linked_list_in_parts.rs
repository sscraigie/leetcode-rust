/**
 * [725] Split Linked List in Parts
 *
 * Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer k, split the linked list into k consecutive linked list parts.
 * The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than one. This may lead to some parts being null.
 * The parts should be in the order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal to parts occurring later.
 * Return an array of the k parts.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/13/split1-lc.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 134px;" />
 * Input: head = [1,2,3], k = 5
 * Output: [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]
 * Explanation:
 * The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.
 * The last element output[4] is null, but its string representation as a ListNode is [].
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/13/split2-lc.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 60px;" />
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], k = 3
 * Output: [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7],[8,9,10]]
 * Explanation:
 * The input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 1000].
 * 	0 <= Node.val <= 1000
 * 	1 <= k <= 50
 *
