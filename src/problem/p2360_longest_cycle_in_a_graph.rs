/**
 * [2360] Longest Cycle in a Graph
 *
 * You are given a directed graph of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.
 * The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array edges of size n, indicating that there is a directed edge from node i to node edges[i]. If there is no outgoing edge from node i, then edges[i] == -1.
 * Return the length of the longest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return -1.
 * A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/08/graph4drawio-5.png" style="width: 335px; height: 191px;" />
 * Input: edges = [3,3,4,2,3]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest cycle in the graph is the cycle: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2.
 * The length of this cycle is 3, so 3 is returned.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/07/graph4drawio-1.png" style="width: 171px; height: 161px;" />
 * Input: edges = [2,-1,3,1]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There are no cycles in this graph.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	n == edges.length
 * 	2 <= n <= 10^5
 * 	-1 <= edges[i] < n
 * 	edges[i] != i
 *
