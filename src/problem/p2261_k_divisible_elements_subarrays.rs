/**
 * [2261] K Divisible Elements Subarrays
 *
 * Given an integer array nums and two integers k and p, return the number of distinct subarrays which have at most k elements divisible by p.
 * Two arrays nums1 and nums2 are said to be distinct if:
 * 
 * 	They are of different lengths, or
 * 	There exists at least one index i where nums1[i] != nums2[i].
 * 
 * A subarray is defined as a non-empty contiguous sequence of elements in an array.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [<u>2</u>,3,3,<u>2</u>,<u>2</u>], k = 2, p = 2
 * Output: 11
 * Explanation:
 * The elements at indices 0, 3, and 4 are divisible by p = 2.
 * The 11 distinct subarrays which have at most k = 2 elements divisible by 2 are:
 * [2], [2,3], [2,3,3], [2,3,3,2], [3], [3,3], [3,3,2], [3,3,2,2], [3,2], [3,2,2], and [2,2].
 * Note that the subarrays [2] and [3] occur more than once in nums, but they should each be counted only once.
 * The subarray [2,3,3,2,2] should not be counted because it has 3 elements that are divisible by 2.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 4, p = 1
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation:
 * All element of nums are divisible by p = 1.
 * Also, every subarray of nums will have at most 4 elements that are divisible by 1.
 * Since all subarrays are distinct, the total number of subarrays satisfying all the constraints is 10.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 200
 * 	1 <= nums[i], p <= 200
 * 	1 <= k <= nums.length
 * 
 *  
 * Follow up:
 * Can you solve this problem in O(n^2) time complexity?
