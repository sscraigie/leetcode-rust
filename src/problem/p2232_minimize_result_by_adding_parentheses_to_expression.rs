/**
 * [2232] Minimize Result by Adding Parentheses to Expression
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed string expression of the form "<num1>+<num2>" where <num1> and <num2> represent positive integers.
 * Add a pair of parentheses to expression such that after the addition of parentheses, expression is a valid mathematical expression and evaluates to the smallest possible value. The left parenthesis must be added to the left of '+' and the right parenthesis must be added to the right of '+'.
 * Return expression after adding a pair of parentheses such that expression evaluates to the smallest possible value. If there are multiple answers that yield the same result, return any of them.
 * The input has been generated such that the original value of expression, and the value of expression after adding any pair of parentheses that meets the requirements fits within a signed 32-bit integer.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: expression = "247+38"
 * Output: "2(47+38)"
 * Explanation: The expression evaluates to 2 * (47 + 38) = 2 * 85 = 170.
 * Note that "2(4)7+38" is invalid because the right parenthesis must be to the right of the '+'.
 * It can be shown that 170 is the smallest possible value.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: expression = "12+34"
 * Output: "1(2+3)4"
 * Explanation: The expression evaluates to 1 * (2 + 3) * 4 = 1 * 5 * 4 = 20.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: expression = "999+999"
 * Output: "(999+999)"
 * Explanation: The expression evaluates to 999 + 999 = 1998.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	3 <= expression.length <= 10
 * 	expression consists of digits from '1' to '9' and '+'.
 * 	expression starts and ends with digits.
 * 	expression contains exactly one '+'.
 * 	The original value of expression, and the value of expression after adding any pair of parentheses that meets the requirements fits within a signed 32-bit integer.
