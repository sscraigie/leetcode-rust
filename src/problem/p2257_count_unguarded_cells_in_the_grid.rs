/**
 * [2257] Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid
 *
 * You are given two integers m and n representing a 0-indexed m x n grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays guards and walls where guards[i] = [rowi, coli] and walls[j] = [rowj, colj] represent the positions of the i^th guard and j^th wall respectively.
 * A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it.
 * Return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/10/example1drawio2.png" style="width: 300px; height: 204px;" />
 * Input: m = 4, n = 6, guards = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,3]], walls = [[0,1],[2,2],[1,4]]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: The guarded and unguarded cells are shown in red and green respectively in the above diagram.
 * There are a total of 7 unguarded cells, so we return 7.
 * 
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 * <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/10/example2drawio.png" style="width: 200px; height: 201px;" />
 * Input: m = 3, n = 3, guards = [[1,1]], walls = [[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[1,2]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The unguarded cells are shown in green in the above diagram.
 * There are a total of 4 unguarded cells, so we return 4.
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= m, n <= 10^5
 * 	2 <= m * n <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= guards.length, walls.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * 	2 <= guards.length + walls.length <= m * n
 * 	guards[i].length == walls[j].length == 2
 * 	0 <= rowi, rowj < m
 * 	0 <= coli, colj < n
 * 	All the positions in guards and walls are unique.
 *
